Looking for hydrocarbons beneath the surface involves geological, geophysical, and petrophysical analysis of subsurface terrain for probable deposits of oil and natural gas. Upon identification of potential locations of oil and gas reserves, the next step is drilling of appraisal wells to ascertain the quantity and quality of underground reserves. The data obtained from appraisal wells is then combined with G&G data to determine the number and location of wells for meeting and optimizing production requirements. After primary (natural pressure and flow) and secondary (water flooding) recovery methods well operators employ tertiary or Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques to boost the performance of depleting wells and maximize production."
